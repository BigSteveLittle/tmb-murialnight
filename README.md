This is an attempt to duplicate Pluralsight's Flow login page to improve my web design skills and provide content for my portfolio. My version is called Murialnight.

## Installation
This is for practice so I'm installing json package files via NPM(Node Package Manager) with no dependencies so as to activate the snyk VS Code extension. NPM can be installed via a download from https://nodejs.org/en or as I have installed it using NVM(Node Version Manager).

To copy my git starter files css/styles.css + README.md + .gitignore run these 5 statements in the command line (you will need to install the wget module which I did via Homebrew):

> mkdir css 

> wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/xz3m74rk9kblv7o/styles-setup.css 

> mv styles-setup.css css/styles.css 

> wget -O README.md https://www.dropbox.com/s/8d05riwy7mb062p/READMETUT.md 

> wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/6l7rl93t4r5fvo5/.gitignore 

I started a local instance of git and pushed it to an empty repo on GitHub with the following commands:

> git remote add origin remote_url

> git push -u origin main
